## Yolo E-commerce Orchestration - Comprehensive Overview
# Technical Overview
This application leverages Ansible for automation and Vagrant to create a virtualized environment. This combination streamlines the deployment process and maintains consistency across various setups.

## Architecture Summary
The application is divided into two primary components:

1. Backend Service: Responsible for data processing and implementing business logic.
2. Frontend Service: Engages users and presents product information.
3. Both components are containerized using Docker, facilitating straightforward scaling and management.

# Core Components
Vagrant Configuration
The Vagrantfile establishes a virtual machine running Ubuntu 20.04 and configures port forwarding for both backend and frontend services.

```bash
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "geerlingguy/ubuntu2004"
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 5000, host: 5000
  config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 3000, host: 3000
  config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.memory = "400"
    vb.cpus = 1
  end
end
```

# Ansible Playbook
The Ansible playbook connects to the Vagrant VM and executes the following tasks:

1. Updates the package cache and installs Docker.
2. Clones the application code from a GitHub repository.
3. Pulls and runs the Docker images for both the backend and frontend services.

# Roles
Install and Update Docker

Refreshes the package cache and installs Docker.
Clones the application code from the designated GitHub repository.

# Launch Backend Service
Retrieves the backend Docker image and initiates it in a container.

# Launch Frontend Service
Retrieves the frontend Docker image and initiates it in a container.
