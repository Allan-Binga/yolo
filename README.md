# Automated Ansible Configuration Playbook

## Overview

This project sets up an automated Ansible configuration playbook that provisions a Vagrant virtual machine with the latest Ubuntu server (20.04) and deploys an e-commerce web application. The application includes a dashboard for managing retail products and provides functionality to add products via a user-friendly form.

## Prerequisites

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) installed on your machine.
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed as the Vagrant provider.
- Basic knowledge of Ansible and Vagrant.
